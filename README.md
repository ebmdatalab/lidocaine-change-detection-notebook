NHS England have a list of [25 items which should not be routinely prescribed](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/items-which-should-not-routinely-be-prescribed-in-primary-care-v2.1.pdf) and we have a dashboard on [OpenPrescribing for these low value medicines](https://openprescribing.net/all-england/#measure_lpzomnibus).

In this repo we are seeking to identify practices and CCGs that have made canges to their lidocaine prescribing possibly as a result of the guidance. Notebooks for the two organisations can be viewed in the notebook folder.




# EBM DataLab's skeleton notebook environment

![status](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/<repo>/workflows/Notebook%20checks/badge.svg)

## Getting started with this skeleton project

This is a skeleton project for creating a reproducible, cross-platform
analysis notebook, using Docker.  It also includes:

* configuration for `jupytext`, to support easier code review
* cross-platform startup scripts
* best practice folder structure and documentation

Developers and analysts using this skeleton for new development should
refer to [`DEVELOPERS.md`](DEVELOPERS.md) for instructions on getting
started.  Update this `README.md` so it is a suitable introduction to
your project.

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/<repo>/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

To do development work, you'll need to set up a local jupyter server
and git repository - see `DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.

## How to cite
